## Roblox old server list
    Warning: this may override with other extensions
A basic old roblox server list, could be used to search through a series of servers to look for a player using their avatar icon, or could be used just to look pretty cool.

## Join servers based on region

The extension is made to just join servers from what region your on causing lower ping, works like 80% of the time because roblox api + my ip account is used.
